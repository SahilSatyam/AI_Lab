**2) Ingestions for Metamart Decommission**

- **What**: Efficiently handled data ingestions from various sources.
- **How**: Demonstrated strong data management and integration skills, ensuring data was accurately and securely transferred.
- **Elaboration**:
   - Over the course of the year, I tackled a series of complex data ingestions as part of the Metamart Decommission project. Each ingestion presented its unique set of challenges, and I want to emphasize the significance of the learning curve I experienced.
   - I encountered diverse data sources, including Datafit, Product Agile Team, Seal, Legal Hold, CIA, DAI, Brews Retention, each with its own data structure and format. Adapting to these differences required me to quickly grasp the intricacies of each source system, and it often involved deciphering legacy data formats and dealing with data quality issues.
   - In some instances, I had to work closely with other teams and stakeholders to ensure the smooth flow of data, which required effective communication and collaboration. For example, collaborating with the Legal Hold team to understand their specific data requirements and ensuring the data was transferred securely.
   - Additionally, I had to keep up to date with evolving best practices in data integration, security, and compliance, and this demanded continuous self-improvement and adaptability.
   - Despite these challenges, I successfully delivered high-quality data ingestions, meeting project milestones and maintaining data integrity throughout the process. This not only contributed to the success of the Metamart Decommission project but also strengthened my expertise in data management and integration.

By elaborating on the challenges you faced and the learning curve you underwent, you can effectively convey your ability to adapt and grow in a dynamic work environment, which adds depth to your year-end review.
